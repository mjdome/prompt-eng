**Problem Identification and Solution Ideation Summary**

The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has led to increasing demand for edge computing solutions that can handle complex AI workloads. However, existing hardware architectures often struggle to provide the necessary performance, power efficiency, and connectivity to support AI and ML applications. Intel aims to address this gap by developing an AI PC SDK, which will enable developers to create custom AI-enabled PCs with optimized performance, reduced power consumption, and seamless integration with Intel's AI and ML tools.

**Requirement Analysis for Intel AI PC SDK**

The following requirements have been identified for the Intel AI PC SDK:

1. **Hardware Requirements**
	* Processors: Intel Core i5/i7/i9 or Xeon processors with integrated AI accelerators (e.g., Intel Nervana Neural Stick)
	* Memory and Storage: Minimum 16 GB of DDR4 RAM and 512 GB of SSD storage
	* Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): Optional, but recommended for advanced AI workloads
2. **Software Requirements**
	* Operating System: Linux-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) with support for Intel's AI software stack
	* Development Environment: Integrated development environment (IDE) with tools for coding, debugging, and testing AI applications
	* AI Framework Support: Integration with popular AI frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Caffe
3. **Connectivity Requirements**
	* Ethernet Connectivity: Gigabit Ethernet or faster for high-speed data transfer
	* Wi-Fi Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) or better for wireless connectivity
	* Peripherals: Support for various peripherals such as keyboards, mice, monitors, and cameras
4. **Power Consumption Requirements**
	* Low Power Mode: Ability to operate in low-power mode for extended battery life
	* Efficient Cooling System: Optimized cooling system to reduce heat generation and maintain performance
5. **Security Requirements**
	* Secure Boot: Support for secure boot mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access
	* Encryption: Integration with hardware-based encryption (e.g., Intel SGX) for data protection
	* Compliance: Compliance with industry-standard security certifications (e.g., PCIe, UEFI)
6. **Development and Testing Requirements**
	* SDK Development Tools: Availability of tools for building, testing, and deploying AI applications
	* Debugging and Profiling: Support for advanced debugging and profiling techniques to optimize AI performance
	* Community Support: Online community forum or documentation for user support and troubleshooting

These requirements will form the foundation for the Intel AI PC SDK, enabling developers to create custom AI-enabled PCs that meet the demands of edge computing applications.
