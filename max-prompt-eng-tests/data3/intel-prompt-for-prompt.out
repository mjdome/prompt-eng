1. **Functional Requirements**: Describe the minimum features and capabilities required for your AI-powered application to operate effectively. This includes the types of AI models and algorithms supported by the SDK, input/output formats, and data processing requirements.
2. **Performance Requirements**: Outline the performance constraints and optimization goals for your application, such as:
 * Maximum latency and response time limits
 * CPU and memory usage expectations
 * Power consumption requirements
3. **Security Requirements**: Identify any security concerns or compliance regulations that must be addressed by your AI-powered application, including:
 * Data protection and encryption standards
 * Access control and authentication mechanisms
 * Secure communication protocols for data exchange with cloud services or other devices
4. **Usability Requirements**: Define the user experience expectations for your application, such as:
 * User interface design and layout requirements
 * Accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support, keyboard-only navigation)
 * Error handling and feedback mechanisms

Additionally, consider any additional factors that may impact your application's success or stability, such as:

* Interoperability with other hardware or software components
* Compatibility with different operating systems or architectures
* Maintenance and upgrade requirements over time

Once you have identified all the key requirements, please organize them in a clear and concise manner, using techniques like use cases, user stories, or SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats). Ensure that your requirement analysis is actionable, focused on delivering business value to users, and aligned with Intel's AI PC SDK capabilities."

This prompt should guide you in developing a comprehensive requirement analysis for the Intel AI PC SDK, covering both technical and non-technical aspects of your AI-powered application.

**Comprehensive Requirement Analysis for Intel AI PC SDK**

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **AI Model Support**: The application must support a minimum of two pre-trained AI models (e.g., image classification, object detection) using the Intel AI PC SDK.
2. **Input/Output Formats**: The application should support at least three input/output formats:
	* Image files (.jpg, .png)
	* Video files (.mp4, .avi)
	* Text data (.txt, .csv)
3. **Data Processing Requirements**:
	* The application must be able to process a minimum of 1000 images per second.
	* The processing time for each image should be less than 500ms.
4. **API Documentation**: The Intel AI PC SDK API documentation must be accessible and understandable by the development team.

**Performance Requirements:**

1. **Latency Limits**: The application's response time should be no more than 2000ms for all inputs.
2. **CPU and Memory Usage**:
	* CPU usage should not exceed 20% of available resources.
	* Memory usage should not exceed 50GB for a single process.
3. **Power Consumption Requirements**: The power consumption of the application should not exceed 100W under normal operating conditions.

**Security Requirements:**

1. **Data Protection and Encryption Standards**: All data processed by the application must be encrypted using at least AES-256.
2. **Access Control and Authentication Mechanisms**: The application must implement secure access control using username/password or multi-factor authentication.
3. **Secure Communication Protocols**: The application should use HTTPS for all communication with cloud services or other devices.

**Usability Requirements:**

1. **User Interface Design and Layout Requirements**: The user interface must be designed with a minimum of 6 colors, following the Material Design guidelines.
2. **Accessibility Features**:
	* Screen reader support for visual impaired users.
	* Keyboard-only navigation.
3. **Error Handling and Feedback Mechanisms**: The application should provide clear error messages and feedback mechanisms for all errors.

**Additional Factors:**

1. **Interoperability with Other Hardware or Software Components**: The application must be able to integrate seamlessly with other hardware components (e.g., cameras, microphones) using standardized APIs.
2. **Compatibility with Different Operating Systems or Architectures**: The application should be compatible with Windows 10, Linux, and macOS operating systems.
